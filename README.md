I wrote this program when I was having a major life crisis: I couldn't figure out what Star Trek Episode to watch! 
So instead of watching Star Trek, I spent a little while writing this program to solve the problem.
This project is obviously a rather minor one, but it's one that I use regularly and enjoyed writing.
