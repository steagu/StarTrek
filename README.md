# Star Trek Random Episode selector

This program reads in a list of all Star Trek episodes, and chooses one at random. Can also take a command line
	argument to select multiple if desired.

I built this program when I had a major life crisis: I couldn't decide what Star Trek episode to watch. This 
	program solves that problem by selecting one at random.
